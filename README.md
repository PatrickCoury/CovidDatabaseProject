A small databasing project myself and a couple of classmates put together for our database class final project.

What it does:
  Gathers COVID information and predicts the trajectory of the pandemic with a variety of adjustable parameters, then graphs it.

My Contributions:
  I set up a .bat file that ran on my computer nightly and swept the State of Michigan COVID website for daily numbers, then prepared the information in .csv files for my classmates to use for their prediction algorithm. All of the Java here is written by me and is what exists in this repository.
